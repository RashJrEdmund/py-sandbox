### My python sandbox

- for learning to write python
- Solving algorithms with python
- And building simple tools with python

### Notes

- So hope this semi-column-less, no variable key word, language doesn't corrupt muy urge for writing neat code in other languages like TypeScript | Java | JavaScript and other languages.
