## Setup

_see the official flask docs [here](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/quickstart/)_

- Make sure to Create a virtual environment (v-e), and install required modules as per my main [documentation](../README.md#configuring-a-virtual-environment-v-e)
  - You'll need to create for both the __basic-flask-app__ and the __beta-flask-app__

### Starting the app

- after everything is setup and installed for each of these 2 folders, start the apps as per their documentations
  - [basic-flask-app](./basic-flask-app/README.md#starting-the-app)
  - [beta-flask-app](./beta-flask-app/README.md#starting-the-app)
